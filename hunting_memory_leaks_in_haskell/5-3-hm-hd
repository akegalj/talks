* from hm we could see that probable couse was Record.hs module (which contains fromBs), Well, that wasn't too helpful.
* but hd told us more. <Aggregates.Record.sat_*> means that most of our memory usega comes from Record thunks

NOTE: explain what thunk is!

* record definition looks ok (it is strict)
data Record = Record {
                      recId :: !Int
                      someField :: !SomeType
                      .
                      .
                      .
                      .
                      .
                      .
                      }

* so problem must have come from outside, from something calling this fromBS. We can find out by trying to find who is retainer of fromBs: -hr -hcfromBs
