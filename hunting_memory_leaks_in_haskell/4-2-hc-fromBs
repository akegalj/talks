* fromBs was creating a Record from one line of an input.

fromBs :: Fields -> FieldsFormat -> B.ByteString -> Record
fromBs header fmt row = Record
    { recId = ...
    .
    .
    .
    bunch of fields
    .
    .
    .
    .
    .
    .
    .
    .
    }

* so ok, I came to concluson that problem might be in accumulating Records
* this is confirmed by running -hd and -hm

-hc cost-centre stack which produced the data.

-hm  module containing the code which produced the data.

-hd  constructor name, for other closures it is a compiler-generated string identifying the closure.

-hy by type

-hr by retainer set
-hb by biography (lag, use, drag, void)
